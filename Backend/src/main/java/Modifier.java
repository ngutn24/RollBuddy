/**
 * In Dungeons & Dragon, every character has 6 ability scores (STR, DEX, CON,
 * INT, WIS, CHA)
 * Genreally, the stats range from 1 to 20 but theoretically can be any number
 * An ability score of 10 is the average, which nets you a modifier of +0 to
 * that ability
 * Example:
 * Strength ability score = 10
 * Strength modifier = + 0
 * 
 * Starting from 10, every increment of 2 gives you a +1 to your modifier
 * 
 * Example:
 * Strength ability score = 15
 * Strength modifier = +2
 * 
 * Strength ability score = 16
 * Strength modifier = +3
 * 
 * Should your modifier be 9, you get a -1 to your modifier. Every decrement of
 * 2 from 9 gives you a subsequent -1
 * 
 * Example:
 * Strength ability score = 9
 * Strength modifier = -1
 * 
 * Strength ability score = 8
 * Strength modifier = -1
 * 
 * Strength ability score = 7
 * Stregnth modifier = -2
