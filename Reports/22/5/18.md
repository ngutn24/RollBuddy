## Individual Contributions:

### Last Week Goals:
- **Tyler**: Work on frontend documentation
- **Esau**: Get backend hosted remotely
- **Arpan**: Make more unit tests and change character sheet fields
- **Jun**: Research and attempt to make frontend look more stylized
- **Jacob**: Look into hosting backend server
- **Thomas**: Implement the remaining UI features we want


### Work Done:
- **Tyler**: Created documentation for components, and as required for this weeks assignment.
- **Esau**: Got backend hosted on AWS on an EC2 instance
- **Arpan**: Finished JUnit testing for backend and updated structures. We will likely NOT go with original DB plan, so no schema was built
- **Jun**: Modified user documentation for this weeks assignment, added some styling for the button
- **Jacob**: Created the backend server to handle creating, updating and returning character data when requested from the front end.
- **Thomas**: Implemented the UI for the miscellaneous menu (inspiration and death saves) and the tab menu (proficiencies and items). Additionally, implemented ability for these menus to save their user inputed data locally. Lastly, restyle characterinfo component to have a consistent style with the rest of the components.



### Next Week Goal:
- **Tyler**: Write tests and complete API changes (new id to reference and use new hosted endpoint on AWS)
- **Esau**: Work with Arpan and Tyler to get DB working and frontend working with the hosted server
- **Arpan**: Iron out how we actually want to store data across sessions (DB, or some other means) and start implementing that
- **Jun**: Continuing on adding more style for the current components, coordinate with the frontend team and see what else need to be done
- **Jacob**: Look into more security aspects
- **Thomas**: Restyle the UI to create a more professional page. Additionally, restyle certain components to improve user accessibility and a better user experience.
