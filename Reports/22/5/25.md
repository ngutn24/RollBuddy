### Work Done:
- **Tyler**:  Complete API changes, update build system to use different API endpoint for development vs. production, helped with some backend infrastructure stuff (reverse proxy to serve API over HTTPS), and miscellaneous documentation fixes. Bonus: playing with firebase functions.
- **Esau**: Been communicating, but no work done
- **Arpan**: Decided on using Firebase as our means of storage, but have not actually implemented it. 
- **Jun**: touch base a bit with thomas but not much work done, going to intergrate his change to local and make sure nothing break before the meeting 5/26
- **Jacob**: Looked into a library for spark java and firebase authorization and database 
- **Thomas**: Restyled UI by adding a background graphic to the component windows, adding drop shadows to create contrast, and increased size of buttons
