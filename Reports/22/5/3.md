# Dumb & Developers Rollbuddy Status Report (4/27/2022)

## Team Report

### Last Week Goals:

- Continue developing backend infrastructure
- Begin implementing frontend view(s)/controller(s) and data modeling
- Linkage with database backend and backend RollBuddy framework and start expanding objects 

### Work Done:

- Expanded backend structures (Objects, classes, diceroller, etc.) and built the base infrastructure 
- Started to create a base web layout 

### Next Week Goals:

- Finalize DB Schema and begin a base connection 
- Begin connecting Frontend to backend structures 
- Continue implementing react components and UI assets 

## Individual Contributions:

### Last Week Goals:

- **Tyler**: Implement the most basic components to work locally (navigation elements, abilities, and character details), Research UI libraries if needed to help with some features such as the tab stack for attributes/notes.
- **Esau**: Gradle migration for both frontend and backend, Job assignments for backend
- **Arpan**: Fine tune backend structures/infrastructure 
- **Jun**: Position of all the component, and a rough layout of the character sheet page
- **Jacob**: Start implementing spark with our backend and just experiment to try and get a better understanding of what and how we should be communicating between front and backend
- **Thomas**: Continue making assets and refine UI

### Work Done:

- **Tyler**: Began using bootstrap (react-bootstrap) as UI framework. It has built-in responsive design and saves us from implementing basic page elements (like the tab-stack, navbar, footer, etc.), Implementation is a WIP, navbar and footer are complete.
- **Esau**: Completed Gradle migration for both frontend and backend
- **Arpan**: The infrastructure has been created for the backend, all objects are near final form, can start connecting Frontend-backend-DB
- **Jun**: Finish the tasks froms 2 weeks prior and last week goals, have a rough layout of the web page. Some formatting did not line up, and no interaction components yet.
- **Jacob**: Started looking deeper into spark and having multiple sessions but did not get a chance to implement anything with our code. 
- **Thomas**: Didn't accomplish goal because I was talking with the rest of frontend (Tyler and Jun) about how we want components to be made and look

### Next Week Goals:

_Note: Some of our goals are more overarching and require more than a week!_

- **Tyler**: Continuing implementation from last week--character sheet components and state are the only focus.
- **Esau**: Working on implementaion of Character session module, Hoping to get a working local MVP of the product by next week
- **Arpan**: Finalize the database schema and start connecting backend to the DB (figure out where to host, how to connect, etc.)
- **Jun**: A code session with Tyler, break down the page into smaller component, also implement interactive component and integrate with current page
- **Jacob**: Start using the character session/character sheet classes to start assigning them from url and possibly try to get this working with multiple sessions but focusing on just one for now.
- **Thomas**: Implement some React components for different sections of our UI
